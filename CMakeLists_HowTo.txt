**Template for CMakeList.txt File**

#- cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8)
#- project("projectName")
#- set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS -std=c++14)
#- add_executable("name" "driverFileName".cpp "headerFileName".cpp)

These four lines (after the space) just get copied into a new text file,
	it needs to be named CMakeList.txt, and then placed in the directory that 
	the rest of the files are placed that need to be compiled together

Before finishing this file, the words in quotation marks must be modified.
	The "name" section just has to do with the name of the file after its compiled.
	The next two .cpp sections must have names that are the exact same as the 
		ones given to the files that are specified.

**Instructions for CMake**

All files needed for the compilation by CMake must be placed in a common directory

A directory named "build" must be placed in the same directory, which can be
	accomplished through the command-line with: "mkdir build"

Move into the build directory and then run CMake via: "cmake .."
	This will compile the files necessary and make then ready for the 'make' section

Next, in the build directory in the command-line, type "make" and an executable file will
	be created with the name given to it through the CMakeList file

To run the file type "./fileName" in the command-line while in the build directory

Once the files are known to work, destroy the build directory by moving out of it into
	the hosting directory ("cd ..") and perform the following command on the 
	command-line: "rm -rf build"
